            Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. 
            Founded in 1939 by <b>Enzo Ferrari</b> (1898â€“1988), the company built its first 
            car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its 
            current line of road cars in 1947.

            The company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in 
            <b>Formula 1</b>, where its team, <b>Scuderia Ferrari</b>, is the series' single oldest and 
            most successful. Scuderia Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events 
            and later in Formula 1, where it holds many records. Historically, Ferrari was 
            also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many wins in races such 
            as the <b>Daytona, Sebring and 24 Hours of Le Mans</b>, as well as several overall 
            victories in the World Sportscar Championship.
